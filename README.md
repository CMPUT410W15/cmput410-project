The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer. Thereâ€™s no really great reason why we should all use facebook.com or google+ or myspace or something like that. If these social networks came up with an API you could probably link between them and use the social network you wanted. Furthermore you might gain some autonomy.

Thus in the spirit of diaspora https://diasporafoundation.org/ we want to build something like diaspora but far far simpler.

This blogging/social network platform will allow the importing of other sources of posts (github, twitter, etc.) as well allow the distributing sharing of posts and content.



## REST API

Our REST API service address is located at: 

	http://cs410.cs.ualberta.ca/api:41080
	
Hostnames will be specified per group, with usernames and passwords distributed directly to the connecting groups. 
The full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/CMPUT410W15/cmput410-project/wiki/API-Documentation).
